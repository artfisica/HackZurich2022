## Challenge description

While recent events let us have a glimpse at what our future in a world of rising global temperatures and increasingly hot and dry summers might look like, climate change and its impact on our everyday lives is a complex issue. Both historical data and official scenarios are available to us- in theory. But can we as citizens truly grasp the scope, the "feel" of climate change?
That's where our challenge comes in: **help us make climate change more tangible by developing a solution that allows citizens to access and comprehend the information provided by the federal administration in an innovative way!**

## Background

As stated in the [sixth assessment report of the IPCC](https://www.ipcc.ch/assessment-report/ar6/), our current 1.1°C warmer world is already affecting natural and human systems in Europe. After this past summer, it's become quite clear that the impacts of compound heatwaves and droughts have become more frequent, with largely negative impacts projected for southern regions. Rising temperatures, loss of biodiversity and an increased frequency of extreme weather events – recent years seem to support what a lot of scientific data shows: the climate has changed, and climate change is accelerating. As an Alpine country, [Switzerland is particularly impacted by these changes](https://www.nccs.admin.ch/nccs/en/home/climate-change-and-impacts/swiss-climate-change-scenarios/observed-climate-change-in-switzerland.html).
![observed changes](https://www.nccs.admin.ch/nccs/en/home/climate-change-and-impacts/swiss-climate-change-scenarios/observed-climate-change-in-switzerland/_jcr_content/par/image/image.imagespooler.png/1540829704666/infografik_obs_change_V01.png)
For instance, already today, Switzerland has experienced a long-term **warming around two times higher** than the global average. As a consequence, [snow cover has diminished](https://tc.copernicus.org/preprints/tc-2020-289/tc-2020-289.pdf), hot days and heavy precipitation have become more frequent and more intense, the vegetation period has been extended and the [zero-degree line has risen](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/joc.7228). And most strikingly, a very recent study has shown that the volume of the [**Alpine glaciers has shrunk by about 50 percent**](https://tc.copernicus.org/articles/16/3249/2022/) since 1931.  
The official Swiss CH2018 [Climate Change Scenarios](https://www.nccs.admin.ch/nccs/en/home/climate-change-and-impacts/swiss-climate-change-scenarios.html) show where and how climate change affects Switzerland. The expected consequences of unchecked climate change for Switzerland include more hot days, dry summers, heavy precipitation and winters with little snow. How drastic these changes will be depending on global efforts to mitigate climate change by curbing CO2 emissions.
Possible scenario in **2060**, without mitigation: The average near-surface air temperature in Switzerland through June, July and August is about **4.5 °C warmer** than today. At the same time, there is up to **a quarter less rainfall**, and the **longest dry period without precipitation in summer lasts about 20 days instead of 11**. For example, in the hottest days in summer, temperatures could shoot up 5.5 °C higher than we are accustomed to now. Hot summers such as in the record year of 2003 have become the norm. Very hot days – with temperatures that used to occur only once in a year – are now occurring on average 18 times per year. [Cities are particularly vulnerable](https://www.nccs.admin.ch/dam/nccs/fr/dokumente/website/sektoren/gesundheit/hitze_staedte_2018_bafu.pdf.download.pdf/2018_OFEV_ARE_quand%20la%20ville%20surchauffe.pdf) to heat stress due to the formation of heat islands, with [effects on health](https://www.nccs.admin.ch/dam/nccs/de/dokumente/website/sektoren/gesundheit/ofev-la-canicule-et-la-secheresse-2018.pdf.download.pdf/OFEV_La%20canicule%20et%20la%20s%C3%A9cheresse%20de%20l%27%C3%A9t%C3%A9%202018%20(2019).pdf).
The official Swiss Hydro-CH2018 hydrological scenarios further indicate that climate change will also [greatly affect water availability](https://www.nccs.admin.ch/nccs/en/home/climate-change-and-impacts/schweizer-hydroszenarien/key-messages.html) over the course of the year, with implications for our forests, agriculture, hydropower and biodiversity.
